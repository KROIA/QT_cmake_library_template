## description: Qt library that lets users and programs script a C++ application in JavaScript: the app defines the callable methods, scripts run sandboxed on their own threads, several at once, with timers, checks, limits, dry run and call stepping. The engine needs only Qt Core + Qml; the optional ScriptHostWidgets library adds the editor, debugger and scripts window.

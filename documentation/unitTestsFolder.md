# unitTest folder
If you want to test your library, you can use the unitTest folder which has the same structure like the example folder.
The only difference is, that it includes the [UnitTest dependency](https://github.com/KROIA/UnitTest) to test your library.

## Create a unitTest project
1. Copy the folder **ExampleTest** from this template to your **unitTests** directory.
2. Change the name of the folder to something else. The name of the folder will automaticly be the same name as the resulting executable.
3. Open the **main.cpp** and change the namespace and include to match your library.
4. Implement your example...

The example will have an icon, you can change it by changing the **AppIcon.ico** file.

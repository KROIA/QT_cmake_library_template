# Example folder
Each example application is located in a subfolder inside the examples folder.
Examples can be used to help a user understand how to use your library.

## Create a example project
1. Copy the folder **LibraryExample** from this template to your **examples** directory.
2. Change the name of the folder to something else. The name of the folder will automaticly be the same name as the resulting executable.
3. Open the **main.cpp** and change the namespace and include to match your library.
4. Implement your example...

The example will have an icon, you can change it by changing the **AppIcon.ico** file
